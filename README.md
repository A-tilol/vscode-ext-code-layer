## Commands

- `codeLayers.addLayer` : Add new layer
- `codeLayers.mergeLayer` : Merge a layer into a base code
- `codeLayers.deleteLayer` : Delete a layer
- `codeLayers.toggleLayerVisibility` : Toggle a layer visibility
- `codeLayers.refreshLayer` : Refresh a layer view

- Supports only simple editing.  
    e.g.) add a layer and write temporary codes and then remove it or merge it.  
    therefore, complicated editing may cause unexpected behavior.
